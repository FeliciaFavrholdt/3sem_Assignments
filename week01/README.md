## Friday presentation
I will be presenting on the topic of **Functional Programming**. This presentation will cover some of the following learning objectives: 

    - What is functional programming and how to use it in Java 8.
    - Illustrate principles of functional programming. Show examples of:
        * Java 8 functional interfaces
        * Java 8 labmda expressions
        * Java 8 method references: static, instance, constructor
        * Java 8 default and static interface methods
