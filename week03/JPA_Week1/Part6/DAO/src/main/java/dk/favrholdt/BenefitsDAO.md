### DATA ACCESS OBJECT ARCHITECTURE

#### Benefits of DAO Architecture: 
The DAO architecture is a design pattern that separates the data access logic from the rest of the application, making it a valuable design pattern for building scalable and maintainable applications. 

It provides a layer of abstraction for interacting with the underlying data storage mechanism, such as a database, and encapsulates the details of how data is retrieved, stored, and updated.

1. **Separation of Concerns**: DAO architecture helps to separate the business logic from the database access logic. This enhances code readability, maintainability, and testability as it is easier to understand and manage each layer independently.


2. **Abstraction of Database Operations**: With DAO, the rest of the application doesn't need to know the intricate details of how data is being stored or retrieved. The DAO interface provides a simple and consistent API for performing CRUD operations on entities, abstracting away the complexities of database interactions.


3. **Promotes Code Reusability**: DAOs encapsulate database access logic, which can be reused across different parts of the application. If the underlying data storage mechanism changes, only the DAO implementation needs to be modified, while the rest of the application remains unaffected.


4. **Facilitates Unit Testing**: By separating database access logic into DAO classes, it becomes easier to write unit tests for the business logic without needing to interact with the actual database. Mock DAO implementations can be created for testing purposes, enabling faster and more isolated testing.


5. **Lifecycle Methods**: Implementing lifecycle methods using `@PrePersist` and `@PreUpdate` annotations to automatically update timestamp fields for created and updated dates ensures consistency and reduces redundancy in the codebase. These annotations allow you to define methods that are automatically invoked before an entity is persisted or updated in the database, helping to maintain accurate timestamps without manual intervention.
